# 🔐 Secure File Access with PIN  

A simple **Python-based security tool** that allows users to set a **4-digit PIN** to protect a text file (`file_3.txt`). Users must enter the correct PIN to access the file's content.  

---

## 🌟 Features  
✅ **Set and Save PIN**: Users set a **4-digit PIN**, which is securely stored in `pin_file.txt`.  
✅ **PIN Verification**: Users must enter the correct PIN to access the protected file.  
✅ **Secure File Access**: Prevents unauthorized access.  
✅ **Input Validation**: Ensures only numeric **4-digit PINs** are accepted.  
✅ **Error Handling**: Prevents crashes if the file doesn't exist.

---

## 🚀 How to Use  
### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**  
Open your terminal or command prompt and run:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AREEB-08/SecureFileAccess.git
cd SecureFileAccess
```

### **2️⃣ Run the Script**  
Start the program by running:  
```bash
python main.py
```

### **3️⃣ Set Your PIN**  
- Enter a **4-digit PIN** (e.g., `1234`).  
- The PIN will be **saved** in `pin_file.txt` for verification.  

### **4️⃣ Access the Protected File**  
- Enter the correct **4-digit PIN** when prompted.  
- If the PIN matches, you can view the contents of `file_3.txt`.  
- If the PIN is incorrect, access is **denied**.

## ❗ Important Notes  
🔹 The **PIN is stored in plain text** (`pin_file.txt`). In a real-world application, **encryption** should be used.  
🔹 Ensure `file_3.txt` exists; otherwise, an error will occur.  
🔹 The program currently supports **only numeric 4-digit PINs**.  

## 💡 Future Improvements  
🔐 **Encrypt the PIN** for better security.  
🔄 Allow users to **change their PIN** after setting it.  
📂 Let users choose **which file** to protect.  
🚀 Add **a graphical user interface (GUI)** for better usability.
